## ToDoTaskList

Our software engineering final project will be a todo task list in the format of a web application. Our application will be similar to traditional todo lists in that it will help a user accomplish short goals in their daily lives. However, it will also allow for an iterative approach to achieving long term goals that a user may be trying to accomplish. An entry in the tasklist can range from a very simplistic, one line task to an complex goal that should be worked toward through multiple parts. This means each task will have a counter that will range from 1 to n, and each task will have buttons to increment or decrement the counter.

The tasks themselves can be recurring or have due dates. Visual feedback should be given to the user to gauge progress. This could be done by a color gradient from red to green, stepping up in color after each successive addition to the counter. Other planned features include a reminder system (via email), task categories, and a high priority flag.
